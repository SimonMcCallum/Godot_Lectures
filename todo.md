## Implementation Notes

### Code Standards
- Use GDScript with proper typing annotations
- Follow Godot naming conventions
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add detailed code comments for maintenance
- Use signals for loose coupling between components

### Performance Guidelines
- Target 60 FPS for smooth navigation
- Keep slide images under 5MB each
- Implement progressive loading for large presentations
- Use object pooling for UI elements
- Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core navigation logic
- Integration tests for multi-monitor setup
- Performance benchmarks for large slide sets
- User acceptance testing with actual presentations
- Stress testing with extended usage scenarios
